const data = await response.json();
if (response.ok) {
    if (data.exists) {
        console.log("Repository is valid.");
    } else {
        console.error("Repository does not exist.");
    }
} else {
    handleError(response.status, data.error);
}
       } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error validating repository:", error);
}
